## The backend demo project
I use IDEA to build this project, and actually there is no Spring Boot 3.2.0 version choice currently in https://start.spring.io/. 
I've also tried alibaba's mirror and their webiste gives something around Spring Boot 2.8.X. So the demo is in 3.3.8.
I used MySQL instead of H2 database, the structure and data building sql file is here.
There is also a test gif below, using Postman to check API.
